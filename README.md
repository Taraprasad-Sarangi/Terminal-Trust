# Offline MFA CLI (Python)

An **offline, security-focused Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) system** implemented as a command-line application in Python. This project is designed to demonstrate how real-world MFA systems work internally, without relying on any network services or external servers.

The goal of this project is to correctly implement the **entire MFA lifecycle** — from credential storage and secret protection to recovery mechanisms and brute-force defense.

## Key Features

- **Password authentication** using Argon2 (memory-hard hashing)
- **Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)** using HMAC-SHA256
- **Authenticator app support** (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
- **QR code provisioning** directly in the terminal
- **One-time backup / recovery codes** (securely hashed)
- **Rate limiting** for password and MFA attempts
- **Temporary account lockout** with a countdown timer
- **Encrypted storage of MFA secrets** using AES-256-GCM
- **SQLite database** for local persistence

---

## Design Philosophy

This project follows the same principles used in real authentication systems:

- **Separation of factors**
  Passwords authenticate _who you are_, MFA verifies _what you have_.

- **Strict authentication order**
  Backup codes are only offered _after_ successful password verification and a failed MFA attempt.

- **Defense in depth**
  Even if the database is stolen, encrypted MFA secrets and hashed credentials prevent immediate compromise.

- **Fail-safe behavior**
  Repeated failures result in temporary lockout.

---

## Authentication Flow (Detailed)

1. User enters **username and password**
2. Password is verified using **Argon2id**
3. If correct, user is prompted for a **6-digit TOTP**
4. If TOTP verification fails, a **backup code** can be used
5. Successful authentication resets all counters
6. Repeated failures trigger **temporary account lockout**

Backup codes act as a **fallback for the second factor**, not as a replacement for the password.

---

## Data Storage Overview

All data is stored locally in an SQLite database (`mfa.db`). The database contains:

- Username
- Argon2 password hash
- Encrypted TOTP secret
- Hashed backup codes (one-time use)
- Failed password attempt counter
- Failed MFA attempt counter
- Lockout expiration timestamp

No sensitive data is stored in plaintext.

---

## Key Management (`master.key`)

To protect MFA secrets at rest, the application generates a local **AES-256-GCM master key** on first run:

- Stored in `master.key`
- Used only to encrypt/decrypt TOTP secrets
- Generated per installation
- **Never committed to version control**

If the database is compromised without the master key, MFA secrets remain protected.

---

## Rate Limiting & Lockout

To prevent brute-force attacks:

- Password attempts are limited
- MFA attempts (TOTP + backup codes) are limited
- After exceeding limits, the account is **temporarily locked**
- A live countdown shows how long remains until unlock

This mirrors behavior found in real authentication systems.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the application

```bash
python MFA.py
```

## Testing the System

Suggested test cases:

- Wrong password → authentication stops immediately
- Correct password + correct TOTP → login success
- Correct password + wrong TOTP → backup code prompt
- Reusing a backup code → rejected
- Multiple failed attempts → temporary lockout with countdown

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:

- Correct MFA system design
- Secure password storage
- Encrypted secret handling
- Recovery mechanisms without weakening security
- Rate limiting and lockout strategies
- Offline authentication architecture
